# swalestrap WordPress Theme 


## About

This is a custom wordpress theme based on the understrap theme by Holger Koenemann which combines the wordpress underscores theme and bootstrap to create a boostrapped starter theme. The specific purpose of this theme was as a final project for my bachelor's degree and is custom made to be a planning platform and digital pinboard for an organization that is decentralized and relies on volunteer work from individuals interested in permaculture gardening. A full workbook for both the development and the design process is available as the PDF document in this directory.

## Basic Features

- This is the build version of this theme, which was compiled and develiped using gulp.js. The CSS was developed using SASS/SCSS.
- Combines Underscore’s PHP/JS files and Bootstrap’s HTML/CSS/JS.
- Features a lush green color scheme and a loop layout which alternates between left and right to create the feeling of walking down a winding path, or being carried along by a brook.
- Uses color to designate what kind what category of work is needed to be done.
- The theme can be further developed using the existing templates, or with the creation of new templates.
